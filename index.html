      <p>They brought a great big elephant 
      Indeed, they brought him everywhere
      It is a massive elephant
      Still, nobody seems to care</p>

      <p> For that reason, I inquired of this elephant
      Because I simply could not ignore
      So I asked them why in the hell
      Would they bring an elephant for? </p>

      <p> An elephant is so obnoxious 
      It drives me up the wall! 
      When people readily ignore it
      Just because it's against the law!</p>
